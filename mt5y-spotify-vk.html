Ребята, вся надежда на вас =) Короче, уже пару недель примерно Spotify не работает толком - запускается нормально (я использую ПК-версию, на Win7), но при попытке. I'm making an addon which aims to support: - A lot of sites which can play multimedia (including YouTube, Deezer, Spotify, VK and more). - Not only toggle playback but also go to next/previous track, seek, change volume etc - View the track info and playback status in a system tray widget. - Be able to perform actions even when the browser window is inactive and the playing tab is not current. I don't have it uploaded on AMO and Chrome Store though, so if you'd like to test it, you should. круто было бы вытаскивать обложки альбомов из спотифай в качестве. а то они показываются крупно только когда нажимаешь на Лирикс. кто знает может можно как-то. I have a hugggggggge playlist on vk.com that i want to put on spotify but have no idea how i would go about doing that. any help would be appreciated.
