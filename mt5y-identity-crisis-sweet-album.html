Great job this last album Sweet, bringing you a more rock sound basic, but very competent, very well with Steve Priest vocalist. This is a great record, and very unfairly treated. Great songs, like "It Makes Me Wonder, " "Hey Mama, " "Falling in Love" and the title track. CD, Album, Reissue, Remastered В магазине CD В ПОДАРОК. Носитель: 1 CD. Производство: Импортное.
